Task 1:
 The difference between the theoretical and the empirical signal was not quantified using the formulae (-10 marks).

Task 3:
 No description about TF-IDF (-4 marks).

 No description about BM25 (-2 marks).

Task 4:
 Partial description of the language models was available (-1 mark).

 lidstone.csv has a low similarity to our solution; RBO = 0.11, NDCG = 1 (-1 mark).

 dirichlet.csv has a low similarity to our solution; RBO = 0.06, NDCG = 1 (-1 mark).

 Setting epsilon to 0.1 is OK, but even smaller values might have been more appropriate given the short length of the passages (-1 mark).
