# Passage-Retrieval-System
The repository shows the project finished in the course 'COMP0084 Information Retrieval and Data Mining' at UCL. 

An information retrieval model is an essential component for many applications such as search, question answering, and recommendation. In this coursework you are going to develop infor- mation retrieval models that solve the problem of passage retrieval, i.e. given a query, return a ranked list of short texts (passages). More specifically, you are going to build a passage re- ranking system: given a candidate list of passages for a query, you should re-rank these candidate passages based on an information retrieval model.
The project aims to build a system
